# D2RApp

### About

D2RApp is an application written in C# that enables the user to mirror MouseMove, MouseClick, and KeyPress input events from a master computer to multiple connected slave computers, where the input events are sent from the master to the slaves when the ALT key is being held down.

It might seem strange but this enables me to be able to have two client copies of Diablo II Ressurrected running on two separate computers and be able to control both running clients with one keyboard and mouse.

As well as being able to generate input events on slave computers, you can also command slave computers to execute a script (a sequence of actions).

**need to put text about scripts here**

Editing scripts...
From the main window, click the `Edit Scripts` button to open the script editor window, then in that window..
Click `New Script` to create a new script.
Once it has been created you can edit its name, change its order in the script list, delete it, and add actions to it.
Click the `Add Action to add a new action to the script.
Once created you can change its order in the action list, delete it, and modify its various parameters.
There are four supported types of action:
MouseMove
LeftClick
RightClick
KeyPress




Clicking the "Accept" button on the "Settings" form, the server will broadcast all scripts to all connected clients, and also save the scripts locally in D2RApp's folder.'




Really you just need to run the software and have a play with it.

I don't think it's terribly difficult to figure it out and if there is something that it does not do, then you can always add that functionality yourself.

### Notes

This software was written to work with my own personal setup which is two separate Windows10 computers, each running one copy of Diablo II Ressurrected in windowed mode.

Your mileage may vary wildly with oher configurations.

### DISCLAIMER
Now I did a bunch of searching on the internet and coudn't find anything about using such software as this with D2R. There is some mention of using input mirroring software with World Of Warcraft, but as far as I could see, nothing directly related to D2R.

The takeaway from this is as follows...

USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF YOUR ACCOUNT(S) GETS BANNED BECAUSE BLIZZARD DEEM YOU CHEATED THEN THAT'S ON YOU, TOTALLY YOU, AND NO-ONE ELSE. DO NOT WHINGE TO ME, BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY WARNED.

Furthermore...

I DO NOT CONDONE THE USE OF BOTS TO AUTOMATE ITEM FARMING IN D2R (OR ANY GAME) AND THIS SOFTWARE WAS IN NO WAY DESIGNED WITH THE AIM OF ENABLING THAT. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS SOFTWARE AND USE IT FOR SUCH THINGS.
